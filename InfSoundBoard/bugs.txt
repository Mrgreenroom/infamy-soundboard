- Added ability to modify playback volume using the volume rocker at any time from within the app.


v1.1 21/02/12 (Changes by Martin Rhodes)

- Fixed previous issue #1 with truncated file playback by switching from SoundPool to MediaPlayer for media playback. There is no noticeable lag.
- The use of MediaPlayer also drastically decreases start-up time (as the audio files are not all pre-cached a la SoundPool)
- Added app icon
- Added list background image
- Normalized all audio files to maximum volume
- Disabled toast message queueing to allow instant toasting (and prevent toast backlogging)
- Moved toast message to bottom of screen
